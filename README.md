# Maysen Greenwood Personal Portfolio

## Personal Website for my computer science career.

## Check it out: [Personal Website](https://maysentg.github.io/personal-portfolio/)

This website is the home for my career in computer science. I will have links to projects I'm working on as well as ways to contact me.

I'm an aspiring full stack developer. I'm currently teaching myself through online learning while do some papers at Uni about internet, web design/development and programming.

This project aims to be a representation of myself, my web development work and to show off my projects!
